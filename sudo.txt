make sure all inputs are case sensative ( so turn them all to upper case)

function game():
    for i in range (5):
        playsgame()
        if winner  = player:
            player total  ++
        els if winner = computer:
            computer total ++

function getcomputerchoices:
    returns scissors , rock or paper
    takes random number between 0 and 1
    if 3.3> returns scissors
    if 3.3< and 6.6> returns rock 

function playsagame(playerselction,computerselection):
    plays a game
    scissors beats paper
    rock beats scissors
    paper beats rock
    rock ties rock
    paper ties paper
    scissors tie scissors

    returns result



buttons checks:

querey select all biuttons 
add check for key down->then add button down class
add check foe key up -> remove button down class
add check for hover -> add hover (increase size)
add check for mouse exit-> remove hover class


next we need to check for which button was pressed
so key up gets put onto all butons indevidualy under there name. this allows for tracback

i dont know how to do this , but :
create new div:
have class for displaying infomation
have 2 divs inside one is fixed on gets re-writen to hold score
have this twice. once for player and once for computer

points-box-computer querey search 
points-box-player querey search 

points-div-player create element
points-div-computer create elemtent

points-div-player textContent (insert points)
points-div-player textContent (insert points)

points-box-computer .removeChild
points-box-player .removeChild

points-box-computer .appendchild
points-box-player .appendchild

i need to go back and add places where it pastes the round winner and why they won. this is going to be pretty easy 
and im to lazy to type it in sudo code:)

over all winner box:
add while loop over event listeners that end when over 5
adding winer to box:
